# Arduino Display Distance

## Description

I made this code in my learning process of Arduino. For this code I used as hardware: 1 x LCD1602 module, 1 x RGB LED, 3 x 220 ohm resistors, 21 x M-M wires, 1 x HC-SR04, 4 x F-M wires; and as software I have used LiquidCrystal and HCSR04 libraries. The code measures the distance using the ultrasonic sensor module and displays it on the LCD1602 module. If there are less than 25 cm the led will light red, if there are less than 70 cm- blue and else it will light green.
